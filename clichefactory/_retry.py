"""Bounded retry helper for service-mode HTTP calls.

Why this lives here
-------------------

Once aio-server is fronted by a load balancer with ≥2 replicas, transient
failures (connection resets during deploys, cooperative 429s from the
per-tenant rate limiter, the occasional 502 from the LB) become routine
rather than exceptional. The server stores idempotency records keyed by
``(tenant_id, idempotency_key, endpoint)`` precisely so a second attempt
can be replayed safely; the missing piece is a client that actually
retries while reusing the same key.

This module is the smallest helper that does that, scoped to the SDK's
own service-mode callsites:

* ``service_extract_via_canonical`` (POST ``/v1/canonical``) — the
  ``idempotency_key`` is already computed once from the request payload
  and lives inside the canonical envelope, so simply re-issuing the same
  body is enough.
* ``service_to_markdown`` (POST ``/v1/ocr/to-markdown``) and ``presign``
  (POST ``/v1/uploads/presign``) — these endpoints accept ``Idempotency-Key``
  as an HTTP header. Callers compute the key once before entering the
  retry loop and forward it on every attempt.
* ``upload_bytes`` — direct PUT to a presigned S3 URL. S3 PUTs are
  inherently idempotent on the URL+content, so retries only need to
  cover transport errors; no idempotency key is involved.

What we deliberately don't do
-----------------------------

* No client-wide retry transport: we keep retries scoped to the three
  service callsites so engine-level HTTP (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI) stays
  unaffected. Those have their own provider-specific retry conventions.
* No exposed config knobs on the public ``factory`` / ``Client`` API.
  Reasonable defaults are baked in; we'll surface kwargs once a real
  user reports a tuning need.
* No retry on 4xx other than 408 / 425 / 429. Auth, validation, and
  not-found failures fail fast — retrying would just delay the error.
* No HTTP-date parsing for ``Retry-After`` (the seconds form covers the
  cases servers actually emit; HTTP-date adds parsing surface for no
  benefit here). When a server sends an HTTP-date we fall back to the
  jittered backoff schedule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    send:
        A no-arg async callable that issues the HTTP request and returns
        the response. Re-invocation must produce the same logical request
        (same body, same idempotency key) so the server can replay a
        previously completed response. The caller is responsible for
        keeping the request shape identical across attempts; this helper
        does not introspect or rewrite the request.
    max_attempts:
        Hard upper bound on total attempts (including the first). Must
        be ≥ 1.
    base_delay_s, max_delay_s:
        Exponential-backoff parameters used when the server does not
        send a usable ``Retry-After`` header.
    retry_after_cap_s:
        Maximum sleep we'll accept from a server-sent ``Retry-After``.
        Protects callers from a misbehaving upstream that asks for
        impractical wait times.
    sleep:
        Awaitable sleep injection point; tests pass a fake to make the
        backoff loop deterministic.

    Returns
    -------
    The final :class:`httpx.Response`. If the last attempt was a
    retryable status, the response is still returned (callers raise
    their own typed errors based on status); if the last attempt raised
    a transport exception, that exception propagates.
